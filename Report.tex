\chapter{Introduction}
This project is part of an assignment in Parallel and distributed systems class of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki. The assignment requires implementing a \textbf{k-NN} algorithm to find the\textbf{ k nearest neighbors} of a set of points from a Query data set, relative to a Corpus data set in a high-dimensional space. This algorithm, implemented in the \textbf{C++} language, given a set of M-points from a Corpus data set and N-points from a Query data set, both in the same D-dimensional space, identifies the k-nearest neighbors of each query point. Using optimized matrix operations as well as the \textbf{OpenBLAS} library, this algorithm handles high-dimensional distance calculations efficiently.

\section{Problem Analysis}
The objective of the assignment is to implement a subroutine in \textbf{C++} that computes the \textbf{k nearest neighbors} of each query point in \textbf{Q(Query set)} relative to a set of points in \textbf{C(Corpus set)} based on their distances, using a multitude of tools for implementing a parallel implementation as well as a version using serial computing.
